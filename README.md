## Cinema project for react + express.js + node course

This project will act as a website for a cinema in which you can 
choose which movie you want to watch and reserve tickets for it.

There will be normal registration and login for users which want to 
only book tickets or give a score and write a comment about a movie.

There will also be an admin role that is responsible for removing bad comments, 
adding new movies and other kinds of management.
